The goal of this project is to determine wethever and how a network has been attacked. We have used three different types of networks, Erdos-Renyi, Barabasi-Albert and Watts-Strogatz. Each network is characterized by 4 metrics, the normalized reciprocal maximum degree, the global clustering coefficient, the normalized average path length and the assortativity. The types of attacks that we have considered are random failures, maximum-degree and maximum-betweenness node deletion (in this case the nodes are deleted based on their centrality in the network measured by the degree and the betweenness). For our task we have used Random Forest algorithm and a feedforward neural network.
